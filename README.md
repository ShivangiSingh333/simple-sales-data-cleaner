# simple-sales-data-cleaner
This is a small Python project where I read sales data from a CSV file, remove incomplete records, and calculate total and average sales. The goal of this project was to practice file handling and basic data processing using Python.

I worked on a small Python project where I used a CSV file containing daily sales records and created a script to clean and organize the data. The program reads the file, ignores incomplete entries, and calculates basic information like total and average sales. It then prints a short summary so that the data can be quickly understood without manually checking the Excel sheet.
Through this project I practiced file handling, basic data validation, and writing simple automation scripts in Python.

What I did in the project:-

1) Read sales data from CSV file
2) Removed rows with missing values
3) Calculated total and average sales
4) Generated a quick summary output
5) Used Python loops, conditions and file handling
